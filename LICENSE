--------------------------------------------------------------------------

cronolog is a simple program to split Apache log files according to a
template and the current date and time.

Please read all the directions below before you proceed any further, and
then follow them carefully.

After you have unpacked your kit, you should have all the files listed
in MANIFEST.

Installation

1) Detailed instructions are in the file INSTALL.  In brief, the
following should work on most systems:
	rm -f config.sh
	sh Configure
	make
	make test
	make install
For most systems, it should be safe to accept all the Configure
defaults.

2) Read the manual entries before running perl.

3) IMPORTANT!  Help save the world!  Communicate any problems and suggested
patches to me, lwall@sems.com (Larry Wall), so we can
keep the world in sync.  If you have a problem, there's someone else
out there who either has had or will have the same problem.
It's usually helpful if you send the output of the "myconfig" script
in the main perl directory.

If you've succeeded in compiling perl, the perlbug script in the utils/
subdirectory can be used to help mail in a bug report.

If possible, send in patches such that the patch program will apply them.
Context diffs are the best, then normal diffs.  Don't send ed scripts--
I've probably changed my copy since the version you have.

Watch for perl patches in comp.lang.perl.announce.  Patches will generally
be in a form usable by the patch program.  If you are just now bringing
up perl and aren't sure how many patches there are, write to me and I'll
send any you don't have.  Your current patch level is shown in
patchlevel.h.


Just a personal note:  I want you to know that I create nice things like this
because it pleases the Author of my story.  If this bothers you, then your
notion of Authorship needs some revision.  But you can use perl anyway. :-)
