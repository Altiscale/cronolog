* Rewrite cronolog as an Apache module as well as a standalone program.

* Option to run an extenal program (such as wwwstat or gzip) on each
  log file once it is finished with.
  (Problem is: if multiple processes are logging to the same file, how
  do we know which one should run the program?)

* Test suite (this should be straightforward with new debug options).
